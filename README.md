# global-session

Wide area consensus based gossiper of live sessions.

This repository will hold a more advanced package for use in a number of frameworks, starting with JavaScript. 

## Purpose

The main of the module is to provide global session management or extra-cluster highly available session recognition. Expect code to use graph expansion, gossip, etc. 

This module is not to be confused with [`global_session`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/global_session?activeTab=readme), which this module may use. That module is a package providing local cluster session management on top of fairly deterministic LRU management.

## State of Use

Currently (this moment) this module does nothing. Check back. This is a placed holder as of 11/11/20223
